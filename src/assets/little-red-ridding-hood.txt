Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Little Red Riding Hood. She was known for her beautiful red riding hood, which her mother had made for her. One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother asked her to take a basket of food to her grandmother, who lived in the woods. Little Red Riding Hood promised to be careful and to stay on the path.

As Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the woods, she met a wolf. The wolf was very hungry and he wanted to eat Little Red Riding Hood. He asked her where she was going, and Little Red Riding Hood told him that she was going to visit her grandmother. The wolf knew that Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother lived in a cottage a little further down the path, so he decided to trick Little Red Riding Hood into going off the path.

The wolf told Little Red Riding Hood that he knew of a shortcut to her grandmother's cottage. The shortcut was through a beautiful meadow, but Little Red Riding Hood's mother had told her never to leave the path. Little Red Riding Hood was tempted to take the shortcut, but she remembered her mother's warning. She told the wolf that she would stay on the path.

The wolf was disappointed, but he was not ready to give up. He told Little Red Riding Hood that he would race her to her grandmother's cottage. He was sure that he could win the race and beat Little Red Riding Hood to the cottage. Little Red Riding Hood agreed to race the wolf.

The wolf ran as fast as he could, but Little Red Riding Hood was faster. She reached her grandmother's cottage first and knocked on the door. Her grandmother was surprised to see her so soon. She asked Little Red Riding Hood how she had gotten there so quickly. Little Red Riding Hood told her grandmother about the wolf and how she had raced him to the cottage.

Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother was very worried. She knew that the wolf was a dangerous animal. She told Little Red Riding Hood to hide in the cupboard. Then she opened the door for the wolf.

The wolf was surprised to see Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother. He had thought that Little Red Riding Hood would be all alone. He asked Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother where she was. Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother told the wolf that Little Red Riding Hood was hiding in the cupboard.

The wolf ran to the cupboard and opened it. But Little Red Riding Hood was not inside. Instead, there was a woodcutter standing in the cupboard. The woodcutter had heard Little Red Riding Hood talking to the wolf, so he had hidden in the cupboard to wait for the wolf.

The woodcutter raised his axe and killed the wolf with one blow. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother were very grateful to the woodcutter for saving them. They all had a feast to celebrate their safety.

Little Red Riding Hood learned a valuable lesson that day. She learned to never leave the path when she is walking through the woods. She also learned to never talk to strangers.
