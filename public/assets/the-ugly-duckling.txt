Once upon a time, on a farm far away, there was a mother duck who laid a clutch of eggs. One of the eggs was bigger and grayer than the others, and when it hatched, the duckling inside was unlike any of the others. He was big and clumsy and ugly.

The other ducklings and the animals on the farm made fun of the ugly duckling. They called him names and pecked at him. The ugly duckling was very lonely and sad. He didn't know why he was different, and he wished he could be like the other ducklings.

One day, the ugly duckling couldn't take the teasing anymore. He ran away from the farm and into the wild. He lived in the woods and by the marsh, but he was still lonely. He didn't belong anywhere.

One autumn day, the ugly duckling saw a flock of beautiful swans flying overhead. He was filled with longing to be like them. He swam into a lake and saw his reflection in the water. To his surprise, he saw that he was no longer an ugly duckling. He had transformed into a beautiful swan!

The ugly duckling was so happy. He joined the flock of swans and they flew away together. He had finally found his place in the world.
