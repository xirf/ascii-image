Cinderella's stepsisters were excited about the event, and they demanded that she help them get ready. As they left for the ball, they left Cinderella behind, taunting her and making her feel miserable.Cinderella, heartbroken, sat by the fireplace crying. Suddenly, her tears attracted the attention of her fairy godmother, who appeared and used her magic to transform Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown, give her glass slippers, and provide her with a magical ride to the palace in a pumpkin carriage. She had to leave the palace by midnight, as the spell would wear off then.At the ball, Cinderella was the most beautiful woman in the room, and the prince fell in love with her at first sight.
