Once upon a time, in a quaint village, there lived a merchant with his three daughters. His youngest daughter, Beauty, was known throughout the village for her kindness, intelligence, and unparalleled beauty. The two older sisters were less virtuous, vain, and greedy.

One day, the merchant received news that his ships, which carried his valuable cargo, were lost at sea. With their wealth suddenly gone, the family was forced to move from their grand house to a small cottage in the countryside. Beauty adapted to their new life with grace, helping her family with their chores.

One day, the merchant received news that one of his ships had survived, and he decided to set out on a journey to retrieve his lost fortune. Before leaving, he asked his daughters what gifts they wanted upon his return. The older sisters requested expensive gowns and jewels, while Beauty asked for a single red rose since she knew her father couldn't afford the jewels.

The merchant's journey took him through a dense forest, and he got lost. Hungry and weary, he stumbled upon a majestic castle. Finding it empty, he entered and was welcomed by a lavish feast. After satisfying his hunger, the merchant looked for the castle's owner to thank him, but he could not find anyone. Before leaving, he noticed a beautiful garden and remembered Beauty's request for a rose. He picked one from the garden and suddenly, the Beast appeared before him, furious that the merchant had stolen from him. In exchange for his life, the Beast demanded that the merchant send one of his daughters to live in the castle.

The merchant agreed, promising to send Beauty to the castle. When he returned home, he shared the story with his daughters. Beauty, knowing her father's life was at stake, bravely offered to go to the castle. Her father, filled with guilt, tried to dissuade her, but she was determined to fulfill her promise.

Beauty arrived at the castle and was initially terrified by the Beast's appearance. However, the Beast treated her with kindness and respect. He provided her with a beautiful room, sumptuous meals, and access to a magnificent library filled with books. Beauty soon discovered the Beast's gentleness and intelligence.

Over time, Beauty and the Beast developed a deep friendship. Beauty missed her family, and the Beast allowed her to visit them, with the condition that she returned to the castle within a week.

Beauty's sisters, driven by envy, persuaded her to stay longer than the agreed time. When she finally returned to the castle, she found the Beast lying motionless, apparently dead. Distraught, Beauty realized that she had fallen in love with him and confessed her love. Her confession broke the curse, and the Beast was transformed into a handsome prince.

The prince explained that he had been under an enchantment, and only true love could break the spell. Beauty and the prince were married, and they lived happily ever after. Beauty's sisters, who had been cruel and envious, received their comeuppance.
